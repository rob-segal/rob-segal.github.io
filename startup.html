      <h3>Background: Exoskeletons for Rehabilitation</h3>
      <p>I initially collaborated on refinements of a hand rehabilitation exoskeleton, aiming to assist patients in regaining mobility. <br>
        However, adoption in hospitals was slow, leading us to explore new applications for exoskeleton technology. <br>
        This pivot sparked the idea of bringing exoskeletons into virtual reality.

        <h3>Identifying the Virtual Reality Problem</h3>
        <p>With limited funding to immediately develop exoskeleton-based VR solutions, we turned our attention to pressing challenges in the VR industry. <br>
          Motion sickness emerged as a major issue, caused by the disconnect between virtual movement and physical stillness. <br>
          We saw an opportunity to create a hardware solution that could bridge this gap.

        <h3>The Alto: A Hardware Solution for Motion in VR</h3>
        <p>To tackle VR motion sickness, we developed Altoâ€”a device that enables users to move physically while navigating virtual environments. <br>
          I prototyped our first product, a VR "hoverboard" with haptic feedback, designed to provide natural movement and reduce discomfort in virtual reality experiences. <br>
          We successfully brought this prototype to production and sold a limited number of devices.
